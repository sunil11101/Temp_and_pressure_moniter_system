# Temp_and_pressure_moniter_system
This is an arduino based project in having a wi-fi module, Temp. sensor and pressure sensor. Aim of this project is to 
make portable, simple and small modules which can be mounted anywhere to monitor the temp. and pressure of that place like 
in a room, motor, engine etc. 
Multiple modules are supposed to be mounted in an area and all the slave modules will connect to a master module having same config. with additional LCD and storage device to display and store the log of all the devices. 
All the devices are powered by a rechargable battery mounted on them . If the modules are used in open area, then a solar panel can also be used to charge the battery at daytime and give power to system at night.
